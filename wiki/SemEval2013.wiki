#summary SemEval-2013 STS baseline system

= !SemEval-2013 STS Baseline System =

This page is intended for all participants of the [http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task6/ SemEval-2013 STS Task]. We describe the task's offical baseline system, which is roughly the system ranked best in the [http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/starsem/proc/pdf/STARSEM-SEMEVAL051.pdf 2012 exercises].

== System Description ==

The system described here uses a simple linear regression model, trained on the training data, to combine multiple text similarity measures of varying complexity. These range from simple character and word n-grams and common subsequences to complex features such as Explicit Semantic Analysis vector comparisons and aggregation of word similarity based on lexical-semantic resources. Our Ô¨Ånal models, one per dataset, consist of a linear combination of about 20 features.
For details, please refer to our [http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Group_UKP/publikationen/2012/STARSEM-SEMEVAL059.pdf system description paper].

The system presented here differs from the original implementation at !SemEval-2012 in that it does not use a distributional thesaurus and no text expansion mechanisms (lexical substitution system, statistical machine translation), as the corresponding code and the accompanying resources cannot be readily made available to the public.

== Installation Instructions ==

The !SemEval-2013 Baseline System is implemented as part of _DKPro Similarity_, a collection of software components for similarity computation between texts of any length, which is intended to be used in conjunction with DKPro Core and Apache UIMA.

=== Step 1: Maven Setup ===

The project is implemented as a Java Maven project. It makes use of some libraries that are not readily available in public Maven repositories. Therefore we have set up a Maven repository which provides these libraries as well as releases of this project.

In order to set up your Eclipse installation properly and use this repository, we ask you to follow
[http://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl/wiki/UserSetup these instructions].

=== Step 2: Checkout ===

Next, check out the subproject as a Maven project in Eclipse {{{trunk/de.tudarmstadt.ukp.similarity.experiments.semeval2013}}}, which resides in the [http://code.google.com/p/dkpro-similarity-gpl/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fde.tudarmstadt.ukp.similarity.experiments.semeval2013 GPL variant] of the similarity package.

== Extend the system ==

=== Add a custom similarity measure ===

=== Use a different classifier ===
