#summary Setting up the resources

Some text similarity measures implemented in our framework operate on lexical-semantic resources, e.g. measures which determine pairwise word similarity on !WordNet. In the following, we describe which resources are required by which measures, and how they can be obtained and installed.

= Explicit Semantic Analysis: Vector Indexes =

Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) is a method which computes similarity based on word occurrences in a given document collection. While it was originally proposed on Wikipedia, other document collections with similar properties have also been found to work well, e.g. Wiktionary or !WordNet.

The vector indexes can be downloaded [Downloads here] for Wiktionary, Wikipedia, and !WordNet.

After the download has finished, unzip the whole folder indexes into $DKPRO_HOME\ESA\!VectorIndexes\{{{<subdir>}}}, where {{{subdir}}} is an arbitrary name for each of the three resources, e.g. "wikipedia".
