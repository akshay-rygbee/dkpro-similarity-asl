#summary Setting up the resources

Some text similarity measures implemented in our framework operate on lexical-semantic resources, e.g. measures which determine pairwise word similarity on !WordNet. In the following, we describe which resources are required by which measures, and how they can be obtained and installed.

= Prerequisite: DKPRO_HOME environment variable =

Before continuing, please make sure that you have set up an environment_variable *DKPRO_HOME* either system-wide or per-project in the Eclipse run configuration. The variable should point to a (possibly yet empty) directory which is intended to store any sort of resources which are to be used by any DKPro component.

= Explicit Semantic Analysis: Vector Indexes =

Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) is a method which computes similarity based on word occurrences in a given document collection. While it was originally proposed on Wikipedia, other document collections with similar properties have also been found to work well, e.g. [http://dkpro-similarity-asl.googlecode.com/files/esa_vector_index_wiktionary_en.zip Wiktionary] or [http://dkpro-similarity-asl.googlecode.com/files/esa_vector_index_wordnet_en.zip !WordNet].

The vector indexes can be downloaded [http://code.google.com/p/dkpro-similarity-asl/downloads/list here] for Wiktionary and !WordNet. As the Wikipedia index is too large (about 1.3 GB) to offer here, please contact us if you want to use it.

After the download has finished, unzip the whole folder into $DKPRO_HOME\ESA\!VectorIndexes\{{{<subdir>}}}, where {{{subdir}}} is an arbitrary name for each of the three resources, e.g. "wikipedia".
